### Minor Changes

- [#4016](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/4016) [`00fab4ce1`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/00fab4ce135eb799cac69140403d7724686733d6) Thanks [@bholmesdev](https://github.com/bholmesdev)! - The use of components and JSX expressions in Markdown are no longer supported by default.

  For long term support, migrate to the `@astrojs/mdx` integration for MDX support (including `.mdx` pages!).

  Not ready to migrate to MDX? Add the legacy flag to your Astro config to re-enable the previous Markdown support.

  ```js
  // https://astro.build/config
  export default defineConfig({
    legacy: {
      astroFlavoredMarkdown: true,
    },
  });
  ```

* [#3986](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/3986) [`bccd88f0e`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/bccd88f0ebe1fbf383c0cee4b27a4c24c72dea72) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - Move the Markdown component to its own package

  This change moves the Markdown component into its own package where it will be maintained separately. All that needs to change from a user's perspective is the import statement:

  ```astro
  ---
  import { Markdown } from 'astro/components';
  ---
  ```

  Becomes:

  ```astro
  ---
  import Markdown from '@astrojs/markdown-component';
  ---
  ```
